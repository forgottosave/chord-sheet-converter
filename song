 

Am G C

Yeah yeah yeah!



Am G C

Am G C





[Verse 1]



          Am         G  C

We don't believe what's on TV

          Am      G       C

Because it's what we want to see

          Am           G           C

And what we want, we know we can't believe

         Am         G        C

We have all learned to kill our dreams.





[Pre-chorus]



Dm                F                           C          C7

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here

    Dm                        F

'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds

            C                  G

And we'll make money selling your hair





[Chorus]



E                   F

I don't care what's in your hair

    C                         G

I just wanna know what's on your mind

E                     F

I used to say I wanna die before I'm old

   C                          G

But because of you I might think twice



             Am   G   C

Yeah yeah yeah! 



Am   G   C

          (Alright, second verse)





[Verse 2]



        Am         G      C

What if my dream does not happen?

          Am               G       C

Would I just change what I've told my friends?

           Am       G       C

Don't want to know who I could be

         Am        G         C

When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep.





[Pre-chorus]



Dm                F                           C          C7

I need to know that when I fall you'll still be here

    Dm                        F

'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds

            C                  G

And we'll make money selling your hair





[Chorus]



E                   F

I don't care what's in your hair

    C                         G

I just wanna know what's on your mind

E                   F

I used to say I wanna die before I'm old

   C                          G

But because of you I might think twice

E                   F

I don't care what's in your hair

    C                         G

I just wanna know what's on your mind



E                     F

I used to say I wanna die before I'm old

   C                          G

But because of you I might think twice





[Outro]



            Am   G   C

Yeah yeah yeah!
